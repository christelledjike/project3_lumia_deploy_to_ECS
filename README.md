# 🚀 Project Overview – ECS Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project is part of a hands-on DevOps learning series designed to help junior DevOps engineers build real-world skills using cloud-native and container-based architectures.

In this project, we build a complete CI/CD pipeline that:

- Builds a Java WAR application using Maven
- Containerizes the application using Docker
- Pushes the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry
- Deploys the container to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- Uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD
- Performs a basic health check after deployment

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will learn how to:

- Containerize Java applications using Docker
- Push images securely to Amazon ECR
- Deploy containers to Amazon ECS (Fargate or EC2 launch type)
- Configure ECS Task Definitions and Services
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- Authenticate GitHub Actions to AWS using IAM roles
- Perform rolling deployments in ECS
- Implement health checks in container-based environments

## 🏗️ Architecture

![ECS CI/CD Architecture](./images/devops-mentoring-projects-3.png)

CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Flow:

- Developer pushes code to main branch
- GitHub Actions pipeline triggers
- Maven builds the WAR file
- Docker image is built
- Image is pushed to Amazon ECR
- ECS Task Definition is updated
- ECS Service performs rolling deployment
- Application becomes available via Load Balancer

## 🔧 Technology Stack
- Component	Version
- OS	Ubuntu 22.04 (local dev)
- Java	OpenJDK 17
- Maven	3.x
- Docker	Latest
- Container Registry	Amazon ECR
- Container Orchestration	Amazon ECS (Fargate)
- CI/CD	GitHub Actions
- Artifact Type	Docker Image

## 🌐 AWS Infrastructure Components

- Amazon ECR Repository – Stores Docker images
- Amazon ECS Cluster – Runs containers
- ECS Task Definition – Defines container configuration
- ECS Service – Manages running tasks
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Routes traffic to ECS tasks
- IAM Roles – Secure access between services

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow (GitHub Actions)

The CI/CD pipeline is defined using:

📄 .github/workflows/deploy.yml

🔄 Pipeline Stages
1️⃣ Checkout Code: Pulls code from the main branch
2️⃣ Build Application
- Runs: mvn clean package
- Produces a WAR file

3️⃣ Build Docker Image
- Builds container image
- Tags image with:latest
- Git commit SHA

4️⃣ Authenticate to AWS

- Uses GitHub Secrets:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION
- Logs into Amazon ECR

5️⃣ Push Image to ECR
- Pushes Docker image to: <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/app-name

6️⃣ Update ECS Task Definition

- Replaces image URI with new tag
- Registers new task definition revision

7️⃣ Deploy to ECS Service

- Forces new deployment
- ECS performs rolling update
- Zero-downtime deployment

8️⃣ Health Check Verifies:

- ECS tasks are running
- Target group health is healthy
- Application returns HTTP 200

## 📦 Container Strategy

Instead of deploying a WAR file directly to Tomcat on EC2:
- The application is packaged inside a Docker image
- Tomcat runs inside the container
- The container is deployed via ECS

This follows modern cloud-native best practices.

## 🔐 Permissions Model
IAM Roles Used
- GitHub → AWS IAM User or OIDC Role
- Push to ECR
- Update ECS Task Definitions
- Update ECS Service
- ECS Task Execution Role
- Pull images from ECR
- Send logs to CloudWatch
- This mirrors real-world secure CI/CD setups.

## 🧪 Health Check Logic

Health validation includes:
- ECS task running status
- ALB Target Group health check
- HTTP check on application endpoint
- Container logs in CloudWatch

## 🛠️ Common Troubleshooting

- View ECS Service Events
- ECS Console → Cluster → Service → Events
- Check Running Tasks
- ECS → Tasks → Logs (CloudWatch)
- Verify Image in ECR
- ECR → Repository → Images
- Check ALB Health
- EC2 → Target Groups → Target Health

## 🔄 Deployment Strategy

- Deployment type: Rolling Update (ECS Default)
- New task starts
- Health check passes
- Old task is terminated
- No downtime
- Future enhancements may include:
- Canary releases
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform


## ✅ Final Result

After a successful GitHub Actions pipeline run:

- Docker image stored in Amazon ECR
- ECS service updated automatically
- Application available via Load Balancer:
- http://<ALB-DNS-NAME>/
